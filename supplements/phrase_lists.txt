Here's a list of phrases that a proof sentences can start with.
Multiple phrases are allowed in each sentence.

In the current version,
the parser will ignore these phrases, but
in later versions, they may become hints for proof reconstruction.

Here is a list of full sentences that may

We proceed as follows.
The (lemma | theorem | proposition | corollary) now follows.
The other cases are similar.
The proof is (obvious|trivial|easy|routine).
